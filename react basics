ReactJS basics
--------------
*. Props vs State in React

1.In a React component, "props" are variables
 passed to it by its parent component.

2."State" on the other hand is still variables,
 but directly initialized and managed by the component.
 
3.The "state" can be initialized by props.

4.and any other method in this class can reference
 the "props" using "this.props".

*. Why super(prpos) or super() in react

1.super() is used to call the parent constructor.
 super(props) would "pass props to the parent constructor".
 For example, super(props) would call the React.Component
 constructor passing in props as the argument.
 When implementing the constructor() function inside a
 React component, super() is a requirement.
